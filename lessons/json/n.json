You do not need to know how to touch type on the\nstandard keyboard in order to learn touch typing on a calculator keypad.  So,\nyou can begin this series right away.\nWhen entering numeric values, accuracy is usually more important than speed.\nTake these lessons very slowly.  Speed will come naturally later.\nAs with the standard keypad, you must start in the HOME position.  Place the\nfirst three fingers of your right hand over the 4, 5, and 6 keys of the keypad.\n(Your thumb and fifth finger are not used.)  Your fingers should be poised just\nover the keys gently brushing them.  Use the thumb or any finger of your left\nhand for other keys, such as the SPACE bar.\nAfter entering each line, hit the ENTER key with the 6-finger (the third finger\nof your right hand).  Immediately return your finger to the 6 key.  It is very\nimportant that you bring the finger back without looking."
