The ten letters on the home row\n(A, O, E, U, I, D, H, T, N, and S) make up about 70% of all keystrokes. These\nten letters alone can form over 3000 words.  Needless to say, having these keys\nin the home row facilitates both speed and accuracy.\nIf you are already an experienced typist on the Sholes keyboard, don't despair:\nyou won't have to unlearn everything you know.  Your basic typing dexterity\nremains with you, regardless of the keyboard layout.  Learning the Dvorak\nkeyboard is like learning to \"play on a new surface\", as a tennis player must\nlearn to adjust to grass court or hard court when she has been accustomed to\nplaying on a clay court."
