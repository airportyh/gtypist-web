      "text": "\t\t\tWelcome to the Colemak Course\nThis course is intended for beginners as well as experienced typists.  The\nColemak keyboard is an alternative to the QWERTY (Sholes) keyboard layout.\nYou will find it easier to learn than the QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts.\nLike the Dvorak keyboard, this is because the Colemak keyboard layout has been\nscientifically designed to minimise cumulative finger motion while typing\nEnglish.  The ten letters on the home row (A, R, S, T, D, H, N, E, I, and O)\nmake up about 70% of all keystrokes.  These ten letters alone can form over\n3000 words.  Needless to say, having these keys in the home row facilitates\nboth speed and accuracy.\nUnlike the Dvorak keyboard layout, however, the Colemak keyboard layout has\nalso specifically been designed to be easy to learn for people who are already\nfamiliar with using a QWERTY keyboard layout.  Despite this, it appears that\nthe Colemak keyboard is as fast as, if not faster than, the Dvorak keyboard.\nFor information about the Colemak kyboard layout, see <http://colemak.com/>."

Similarly, the fingers of the right hand should be\nplaced over the N-key, the E-key, the I-key, and the O-key.  This is called the\nHOME position.  Only these fingers should be used to press the keys that they\nare above.\nIn addition to these keys, the SPACE bar should be pressed with the thumb of\nthe right hand.  At the end of every line, the RETURN key should be pressed\nwith the fourth finger of the right hand."
